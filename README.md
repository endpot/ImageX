# ImageX
A free image host built with laravel and MinIO (Recommend: minio gateway b2 mode).

**ImageX has been refactored using GoLang, and opensourced at [endpot/ImageGo](https://github.com/endpot/ImageGo).**

# Features
1. Built on Laravel, the best PHP Framework
2. All images are stored on B2 Cloud Storage (High Performance Cloud Storage at 1/4 the Price)
3. Only hot images are cached (hot images are those viewed by visitors recently)
4. Dupe checking: When a duplicate image is uploaded, a connection would be created at the database and no disk space would be consumed.
5. NFSW tag support
6. and so on...

# How to use
## TL;DR
1. Clone this project to your web application dir
2. Rename .env.example to .env, and change the settings in it, especially those MinIO related
3. Run `php composer.phar install`
4. Set up crontab to run [Laravel Schedule](https://laravel.com/docs/scheduling#introduction)
